Hey there! I'm <i>Samantha</i>. ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š

I'm a software engineer/front-end developer with a strong passion for UI/UX design, software quality, and topics of accessibility. I'm currently working with React.js and studying software testing, front-end documentation, design patterns, and a bit of back-end development and cloud.

My main knowledge in technologies is **Javascript**, **React**, **Next.js**, **SASS**, **styled-components** and **Typescript**.

I'm also comfortable using state management libraries like **Mobx** and **Redux**, front-end tooling like **Vite** and **Webpack**, **Jest**, **Storybook**, **Figma** and I can manage with some help with **Node.js** and **back-end development**.

I am currently working as a _Mid-Level Front-end Developer_ for [Junto Seguros](**).
